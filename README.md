# ECPSModeling

Welcome to ECPSModeling repository, this tool it was designed to support the transformation process from Simulink model to AADL representations. The transformation process it was initially proposed by Rosane Passarini on its [PhD Thesis](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/xmlui/handle/123456789/128784), and its extended as part of a Fernando S. Gon√ßalves PhD thesis entitled Integrated Method for Designing Complex Cyber-Physical Systems avilable [here](https://cister.isep.ipp.pt/docs/integrated_method_for_designing_complex_cyber_physical_systems/1452/).

Aiming to provide a quick access to the proposed tool, on the [run](https://github.com/fernandosgoncalves/ECPSModeling/tree/master/run/plugins) directory its possible to access the plugin jar file, a quick start instalation manual and a Simulink model that should be used as the transformation process example.

In order to provide more information related to the designed tool a paper its was publised entitled Model driven engineering approach to design sensing and actuation subsystems avilable [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733566). In the same way, a video was created, that detail the tool usage, that is available [here](https://youtu.be/hBwQ2tfLx1I).

If you need more information please contact the tool authors by e-mail fernando.goncalves@ifsc.edu.br
